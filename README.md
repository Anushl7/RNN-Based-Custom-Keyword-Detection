# RNN-Based-Custom-Keyword-Detection>

Developed an RNN-based custom keyword detection system using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras. Leveraged
MFCCs for feature extraction from audio signals and employed a Bidirectional LSTM model to capture temporal
dependencies. Implemented data augmentation techniques such as time-stretching and pitch-shifting to enhance
model robustness. Achieved efficient keyword detection in noisy environments, optimizing the model with batch
normalization, dropout, and the Adam optimizer for improved accuracy and generalization.
